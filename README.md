# Order-Matching-Engine
The objective of this assignment is to develop a comprehensive simulation of a stock exchange environment, where traders engage with the market. This involves designing and implementing several crucial components, including the stock exchange itself, an order-matching engine, and an order management system for traders. The simulation entails generating buy and sell actions at random intervals for each trader, following specific rules to determine the price at which these orders are placed. The primary goal is to evaluate and analyze the resulting profits or losses of each trader at the conclusion of the simulated trading day.
